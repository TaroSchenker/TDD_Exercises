/* 
  1. Array Filter Testing with Generics

  Write a test for a function called `filterArray` that filters an array based on a condition provided as a function. 
  The function should take an array and a condition function as arguments, and return a new array that contains elements 
  for which the condition function returns true.
  Then implement the function to make the test pass.

/* 
  2. KeyValueStore Testing with Generics

  Write a test for a class called `KeyValueStore`. The class should have the following methods:
    - `set(key: string, value: T): void` : sets the value at key to value
    - `get(key: string): T | undefined` : gets the value at key, or undefined if it does not exist

  The `KeyValueStore` should be generic and work with values of any type.
  Then implement the class to make the test pass.

/* 
  3. TypeMapping Testing with Generics

  Write a test for a function called `mapTypes`. The function should take an array of any type and a mapping function as arguments. 
  The mapping function should transform each element in the input array to a different type, 
  and `mapTypes` should return a new array with the transformed elements.
  Then implement the function to make the test pass.

/* 
  4. CompareEntities Testing with Generics

  Write a test for a function called `compareEntities`. The function should take two entities of any type and a comparator function. 
  The comparator function should accept two parameters of the same type as the entities and return a boolean representing whether the entities are equal.
  Then implement the function to make the test pass.

/* 
  5. Identity Function Testing with Generics

  Write a test for a function called `identity`. The function should take a single argument and return that argument. 
  The function should be generic and work with arguments of any type.
  Then implement the function to make the test pass.
