  1. Intermediate Array manipulation testing

  Write a test for a function called `removeDuplicates` that removes all duplicates from an array. 
  The function should take an array as an argument, and return a new array with all duplicates removed. 
  Then implement the function to make the test pass.

  2. Intermediate Async processing testing

  Write a test for a function called `processData` that fetches data from a given URL, 
  processes it in a specific way (e.g., filtering, sorting), and returns the processed data. 
  You may use a library such as axios for making the HTTP request.
  Then implement the function to make the test pass.

/* 
  3. Custom Data Structure testing

  Write a test for a class called `MyStack` that implements a basic stack with `push`, `pop`, and `peek` methods. 
  The `push` method should add an item to the top of the stack, `pop` should remove the top item, 
  and `peek` should return the top item without removing it.
  Then implement the class to make the test pass.

  4. Sorting Algorithm testing

  Write a test for a function called `quickSort` that sorts an array in ascending order using the Quick Sort algorithm. 
  The function should take an array as an argument, and return a new array that contains the same elements but sorted.
  Then implement the function to make the test pass.

  5. Intermediate Object Manipulation Testing

  Write a test for a function called `objectInverter` that inverts the keys and values of an object. 
  The function should take an object as an argument, and return a new object where keys become values and values become keys.
  Then implement the function to make the test pass.

  9. String Manipulation Testing

  Write a test for a function called `reverseWords` that reverses every word in a string, but not the entire string itself. 
  The function should take a string as an argument, and return a new string where every word is reversed, 
  but the order of the words in the sentence stays the same.
  Then implement the function to make the test pass.
